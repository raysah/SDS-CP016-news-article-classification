              "0  Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\\n\\nQuarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\\n\\nThe firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\\n\\nTime Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\\n\\nTime Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\\n\\nTimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.   \n",

In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.   \n",

In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda. But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.\\n\\nOnly the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\",\n          \"BBC web search aids odd queries\\n\\nThe BBC's online search engine was used a record amount in 2004, helping with enquires both simple and strange.\\n\\nMore than 277 million enquiries were made, asking for informaton of a wide range of subjects. The most requested search terms of 2004 included games, EastEnders, CBBC, John Peel, Harry Potter and Olympics. But there were many strange enquiries, including: what is a dog?, how do you say basketball? and what is the biggest collection of naval fluff? The search engine works by matching key words typed in to different web pages but many people still type in natural language questions. Here are some of the strangest queries of 2004 - spelling and grammar errors left untouched - and their possible solutions:\\n\\n\\n - How to fold a serviette like an elf's boot? \\n \\n\\n\\n - How do I structure a French letter? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is better one long vacation each year or several short vacations throughout the year? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is so special about the Swiss? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What are the contemporary issue in nurses? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is the number 4 in this number 40052308090? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is up? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is the name of James Martin's dog? \\n \\n\\nSearch engines are key to the way people use the internet. Companies such as Google have become of paramount importance as they dictate how people travel through websites while online.\",\n          \"Serena becomes world number two\\n\\nSerena Williams has moved up five places to second in the world rankings after her Australian Open win.\\n\\nWilliams won her first Grand Slam title since 2003 with victory over Lindsay Davenport, the world number one. Men's champion Marat Safin remains fourth in the ATP rankings while beaten finalist Lleyton Hewitt replaces Andy Roddick as world number two. Roger Federer retains top spot, but Safin has overtaken Hewitt to become the new leader of the Champions Race. Alicia Molik, who lost a three-set thriller against Davenport in the quarter-finals, is in the women's top 10 for the first time in her career. Her rise means Australia have a player in the top 10 of the men's and women's rankings for the first time in 21 years. And Britain's Elena Baltacha, who qualified and then reached the third round, has risen to 120 in the world - a leap of 65 places and her highest ranking yet.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "\n",
        "Ryanair has been given the largest fine of €108m (£90m), followed by EasyJet's penalty of €29m (£24m).\n",
        "\n",
        "Vueling, Norwegian and Volotea were issued with sanctions by Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry on Friday.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ministry said it plans to ban practices such as charging extra for carry-on hand luggage and reserving seats for children.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fines are the biggest sanction issued by the ministry, and follow an investigation into the budget airline industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ministry said it had upheld fines that were first announced in May after dismissing appeals lodged by the companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vueling, the budget arm of British Airways owner IAG, has been fined €39m (£32m), while Norwegian Airlines and Volotea have been fined €1.6m (£1.3m) and €1.2m (£1m) respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fines were issued because the airlines were found to have provided misleading information and were not transparent with prices, \"which hinders consumers' ability to compare offers\" and make informed decisions, the ministry said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ryanair was accused of violating a range of consumer rights, including charging for larger carry-on luggage, seat selection, and asking for \"a disproportionate amount\" to print boarding passes at terminals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each fine was calculated based on the \"illicit profit\" obtained by each airline from these practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the fines were \"illegal\" and \"baseless\", adding that he will appeal the case and take it to the EU courts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Ryanair has for many years used bag fees and airport check-in fees to change passenger behaviour and we pass on these cost savings in the form of lower fares to consumers,\" he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Easyjet and Norwegian said they would also appeal the decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spanish airline industry watchdog, ALA, plans a further appeal and has called the ministry's decision \"nonsense\", arguing the fine infringes EU free market rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Andrés Barragán, secretary general for consumer affairs and gambling at the ministry, defended the fines, saying the government's decision was based on Spanish and EU law.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"It is an abuse to charge €20 for just printing the boarding card in the airport, [it's] something no one wants,\" he told the BBC's World Business Report programme.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"This is a problem consumers are facing not only in Spain but in other EU countries.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Consumer rights association Facua, which has campaigned against the fees for six years, said the decision was \"historic\".\n",
